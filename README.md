# INTRODUCTION
This is a Java-based GUI program that simulates the real-life card gameBoard called UNO with a user-friendly interface. The program has two main screens: one for the main menu and one for the main gameBoard. The gameBoard application can also be manipulated within a multi computer network. UNO is an American card gameBoard with 4 players in a match. Players can play with their friends and family or with our built-in bots. Vacant spots in gameBoard will be replaced by bots.
At the start of the gameBoard, each player has 7 cards. The pile of the other cards are placed facing down. When a card is discarded, the next player has to play a card which has the same number, color or action as the last discarded card. Apart from the cards with numbers, there are also Wild Cards which can carry multiple colors, Wild Draw Two/Four cards which make the next player draw two/four cards from the draw pile and Skip cards which enable the player to skip their turn. If a player does not have any cards with the same color or action as the last one on the discard pile or prefer not to discard even when they have the playable card, they must draw a card at the top of the draw pile. If that card can be discarded, the player can either play it or keep it and wait for the next turn. Other than that, the player can also put forward a Wild Card or Wild Draw Four card.

* Setup the JDK to version 11.
## Add the JavaFX library
* From the main menu, select File | Project Structure or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S on the toolbar.
* Specify the path to the lib folder in the JavaFX SDK package, for example: C:\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib
* In the Choose Modules dialog, select the FinalASM_OOP module and click OK.
## Add VM options
* From the main menu, select Run | Edit Configurations.
* Select Application | Main from the list on the left. *In the VM options field, specify: --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add     modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media
* Instead of %PATH_TO_FX%, specify the path to the JavaFX SDK lib directory, for example: C:/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib.
## Compile and Run
* Open class Main.java.
* Press Shift + F10 or go to Run tools and hit Run 'Main'.
* To test the Network feature by setting up a localhost, run ServerMain and then run at most 4 Main in parallel mode (can be setup in the Run | Edit Configurations)
