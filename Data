the algorithm has space efficient. Space is also issues.

A1. We will calculate the ratio of the demand, instead of divided into the middle. 
loglogN
A2. Reverse the array,
-  Split the array in the k element.
- Reverse all 2 sub-arrays.

1. we create 3 variables: currentLow , currentHigh, potentialLow.
Check the range of currentLow and currentHigh. 
if the point is lower than currentLow, then it is potentialLow
then check potentialLow if the range of potentialLow vs currentHigh is bigger than the range of currentLow and currentHigh. 
If so, currentLow is potentialLow.

Do the Q2(pseudocode) and Q4(code)
